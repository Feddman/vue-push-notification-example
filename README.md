Vue.js Push Notification Example
================================

An example repo for using browser push notifications with Vue.js. We also use Firebase in this example as it can be used to send the notifications for free and with zero-configuration.

### Requirements

* Firebase account
* Server running on the project root

### Installation

* Create a `manifest.json` [following this structure](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/push-notifications-on-the-open-web#add_a_web_app_manifest)
* Create a `firebase.json` with the Firebase Web credentials
* Make sure the Firebase table can be written to
